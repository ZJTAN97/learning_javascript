Question 1.
Literally just anagram check


Question 2.
[1,3,4,2]

within each number in the array, check through all the array, i guess brute force would result in O(n^2)
Tried to optimize with O(n) but dont seem to pass all cases

something something can divide by itself, no remainder then consider it as 1 result,
then if that number can do for other numbers, add 1 more to the result
then the more length it has --> more security
